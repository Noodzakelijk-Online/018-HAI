// readinessHandler exposes only the aggregate readiness state needed by a
// load balancer or container orchestrator. Detailed checks can contain
// internal topology and configuration information, so they are served by the
// authenticated system readiness endpoint instead.
//
// The three states are distinct on purpose, because an operator needs to tell
// them apart:
//
//	ready     — configuration is sound and every dependency answered.
//	degraded  — serving, but something is missing or unused: no LLM provider,
//	            Kafka down (events dropped), a placeholder secret still in place.
//	not_ready — a critical dependency is unreachable. 503, so an orchestrator
//	            stops sending traffic to a process that cannot serve it.
//
// Only a critical failure returns 503. A degraded service is still a serving
// service, and reporting it as down would be its own kind of dishonesty.
//
// The diagnose function is injected so the handler is testable without touching
// global configuration or opening real sockets.
